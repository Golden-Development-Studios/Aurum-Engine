# Aurum Framework & Aurum Engine
### By Golden Developments

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

**Aurum** is a dual-layer system designed and engineered by **Golden Developments** to provide a fully modular, high-performance foundation for simulation, game development, and general-purpose real-time systems.  
It consists of two main components:

- **Aurum Framework:**  
  A low-level C++ foundation providing memory management, math, ECS, and platform abstractions.

- **Aurum Engine:**  
  A higher-level engine built upon the framework to enable game and simulation development at any scale.

The long-term goal is to create a scalable ecosystem capable of handling **KSP-level complexity** — large-scale deterministic simulations, procedural systems, and cross-domain development.

## 🎯 Mission Statement

To create a **brutally efficient**, **modular**, and **scalable** engine framework that empowers developers to build anything — from indie-scale prototypes to universe-sized simulations — with **clarity, performance, and control**.

---

## 💡 Core Design Philosophy

1. **Transparency:** Minimal abstraction; developers can see and modify everything.
2. **Determinism:** Predictable, repeatable simulation results.
3. **Modularity:** Every system should be replaceable, extendable, or removable.
4. **Performance by Design:** Manual control of memory, concurrency, and data layout.
5. **Data-Driven Architecture:** Everything configurable without recompilation.
6. **Simplicity in Complexity:** Complex systems built from small, understandable parts.

## 🧱 Core Components

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Platform Layer** | Windowing, input, timing, filesystem, platform abstraction. |
| **Core Library** | Math, memory allocators, event bus, and configuration systems. |
| **ECS Layer** | Entity-component architecture for runtime systems. |
| **Render System** | Rendering abstraction (OpenGL/Vulkan) with scene pipeline. |
| **Physics Layer** | Deterministic physics and simulation foundation. |
| **Scripting Layer** | Lua/Python bindings for modding and scripting. |
| **Tooling Layer** | Debug UI, profilers, visual editors, and asset tools. |
