# 🛣️ Aurum Framework & Engine – Development Roadmap

---

## 🧱 Beginner Phase – Core Foundations

**Goal:** Establish the foundational architecture and runtime.

### 🧩 Tasks
- [ ] Setup repository and base structure  
- [ ] Initialize build system (CMake)
- [ ] Implement logging and error handling
- [ ] Create math library (vec2, vec3, mat4, quaternion)
- [ ] Platform abstraction (Windows)
- [ ] Input system (keyboard, mouse)
- [ ] Windowing via SDL/GLFW
- [ ] Basic renderer (OpenGL/Vulkan)
- [ ] Entity Component System (core loop, registry)
- [ ] File IO utilities (config, JSON/YAML)
- [ ] Sandbox demo project

---

## ⚙️ Intermediate Phase – Engine Systems

**Goal:** Introduce tools, scripting, physics, and core engine features.

### 🧩 Tasks
- [ ] Scene graph and spatial hierarchy
- [ ] Physics engine integration or custom solver
- [ ] Scripting layer (Lua/Python binding)
- [ ] Asset importer/exporter (FBX, OBJ, PNG, WAV)
- [ ] Runtime asset cache and manager
- [ ] ImGui debug interface
- [ ] Inspector and profiler tools
- [ ] Plugin/module loader
- [ ] Scene serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Basic gameplay logic tests

---

## 🚀 Advanced Phase – Scalable Ecosystem

**Goal:** Scale the architecture for large-scale simulations and tool ecosystems.

### 🧩 Tasks
- [ ] Multithreaded job/task scheduler
- [ ] Deterministic simulation framework
- [ ] Procedural terrain/planet generation
- [ ] Async world streaming
- [ ] High-precision double-based physics
- [ ] Hot-reloadable plugins
- [ ] Networking core (deterministic or state-sync)
- [ ] Custom editor (Aurum Editor)
- [ ] Modular runtime (Aurum Runtime)
- [ ] Long-term: Cloud/cluster simulation compatibility
