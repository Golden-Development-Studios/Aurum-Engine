# 🌌 Aurum Ecosystem – Future Vision

---

## 🌍 The Long-Term Goal

To evolve the Aurum Framework and Engine into a **universal development ecosystem** supporting:

- Game development
- Large-scale scientific simulation
- AI/robotics simulation environments
- Real-time visualizations and design tools

Aurum should be able to simulate complex physical and procedural systems — *KSP-level planetary mechanics, economy systems, modular engineering, and beyond.*

## 🪐 Vision Pillars

1. **Scalability**
   - From 10 to 10 million entities.
   - Multi-threaded and deterministic by default.

2. **Moddability**
   - Lua/Python layer for all exposed engine systems.
   - Plugin architecture allowing external developers to extend capabilities.

3. **Cross-Platform**
   - Windows → Linux → eventually Mac.
   - Core design independent from any specific OS dependency.

4. **Data-Driven Core**
   - Configurable through JSON, YAML, or custom DSL.
   - Systems reloadable without recompiling.

5. **Toolchain Evolution**
   - Custom editor (Aurum Editor)
   - Asset manager, profiler, simulation visualizer.
